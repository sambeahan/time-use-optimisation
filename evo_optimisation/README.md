# Evolutionary Time-Use Optimisation

## Single Objective

To run the single day problem optimising a single objective using a simple genetic algorithm, run the `genetic_single.py` file. The objective to be optimised can be swapped out using the global variable at the beginning of the file.

## Multi objective

Run the file `multi_obj_opt.py` to run the single day problem using NSGA-II for multi-objective optimisation, utilising the implementation in `nsga_ii.py`

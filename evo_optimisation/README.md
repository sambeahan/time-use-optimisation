# Evolutionary Time-Use Optimisation
To run the single day problem optimising a single objective using a simple genetic algorithm, run the `genetic_single.py` file. Run the file `run.py` to run the single day problem using NSGA-II for multi-objective optimisation, utilising the implementation in `nsga_ii.py`

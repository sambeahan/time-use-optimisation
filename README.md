# AI-Based Time Use Optimisation for Improving Health Outcomes

This is a repository for optimising daily time use to achieve better health outcomes. To install the required dependecies for this repository, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The evolutionary optimisation is contained in the `evo_optimisation` folder

`reinforcement_learning` contains the reinforcement learning approach for optimisation.

The `evo_optimisation` and `reinforcement_learning` folders both contain a seperate README for further instructions.

`graph_generation` contains the code used to generate graphs displaying optimisation results.

`objective_functions.py` contains health outcome objective functions for the optimisation algorithms to use.
